<h1>Enterprise Mobility Manager ${product.version} Release Notes</h1>

<p>
    WSO2 Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) is a unique solution designed to specifically address the mobile enterprise needs. EMM includes of two key aspects:
    Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM). WSO2 EMM also supports single sign-on (SSO) and multi-tenancy.
</p>
<p>
	EMM enables organizations to secure, manage and monitor Android and iOS powered devices (i.e., smart phones, ipod touch devices and tablet PCs), irrespective of the mobile operator, service provider, or the organization. Users need to accept the Policy agreement, which states all the actions that can be carried out on the device when enrolling with EMM. EMM only controls the corporate data that is present on the devices, while the personal data is left untouched.
</p>

<h3>
    What is new in this release
</h3>
<p>
    <b>First user experience</b>
</p>
<p>
    In the previous WSO2 EMM releases it was mandatory for the users to fully configure WSO2 EMM before being able to run the product. Now, WSO2 EMM 2.2.0
    binary pack comprises of a default Android Agent. Thereby, enabling users to seamlessly download and run EMM without any prior configurations. This will
    allow users to use Android devices to get a better understanding of WSO2 EMM.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Local notification method for Android devices</b>
</p>
<p>
    The GCM server has a limitation on the number of messages that can be sent to the GCM server. However, this new Local notification method for Android
    devices does not make use of the GCM server. Thereby, the number of messages sent via the GCM will be minimized. Furthermore, the Local notification method
    does not send the messages via the payload, as it did in previous EMM versions. Thereby, this will minimize the MDM command loss.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Tenant based configuration</b>
</p>
<p>
    The tenant admin will be able to use the Configuration Manager wizard to setup the tenant's general, Android and iOS configuration details. Thereby, this
    allows each tenant to customize their settings based on their requirements. For more information, see Tenant Based Settings.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Ability to change password</b>
</p>
<p>
    Previously, users were not allowed to change the default password that was assigned by WSO2 EMM. However, now users are allowed to change their password.
    Thereby, users will be able to change their default password to a password of their choice.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Removal of devices from WSO2 EMM</b>
</p>
<p>
    Previously, administrators were not allowed to remove devices from WSO2 EMM after they were enrolled. However, now the administrators can use the
    Enterprise Wipe feature to remove enrolled devices from WSO2 EMM. Thereby, this will enable the administrators to maintain WSO2 EMM efficiently.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Improved API security</b>
</p>
<p>
    The APIs that are exposed to the devices have been secured in WSO2 EMM using OAuth.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Improved compliance monitoring</b>
</p>
<p>
    When the system is clustered, then using the nTask Component, only one node will be allowed to perform the compliance monitoring that will dispatch
    messages to the GCM or APNS.
</p>
